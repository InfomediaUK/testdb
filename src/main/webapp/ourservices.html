<h3>A robust procurement system</h3>

<p>MMJ will work in partnership with both Clients and Agencies to achieve the best possible practice available within the temporary staffing market.  MMJ is a cost effective new generation technology providing a bespoke IT system that will save management time and money by reducing if not eliminating the problematic components surrounding agency bookings, such as sales calls, negotiations, timesheet management, invoicing, and all paper work processes, leaving a simple yet thorough transaction that allows the client and the agency a more effective way of running their businesses.</p>
